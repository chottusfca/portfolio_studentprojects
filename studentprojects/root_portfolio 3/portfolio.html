                        An anti- war poster created during the start of 
                        the war in Ukraine, early 2022. The intent behind it was to 
                        make Ukraine an idealistic, fantasy land to 
                        emphasize their flourishing country before 
                        destruction hit. The stylistic inspiration behind 
                        this piece was the Wizard of Oz, which connected 
                        to the sense of a utopian society. The red tank was 
                        decorated with glitter to represent the red slippers 
                        in the movie, symbolic of revolution. Although the 
                        slippers' powerful forces are in the wrong hands, 
                        which is why destruction is being shown. Setting this 
                        piece in Ukraines' sunflowers fields, also hinting at 
                        their flag with the surrealist blue background.

                    <h2>
                        The featured type studies were developed in Fall of 2022. 
                        The content and compositions contend with a diversity of 
                        subject matters, mediums, typographic arrangements, hierarchy 
                        of information, and underlying text/grid structures. 
                        This series serves to catalogue a foundational understanding 
                        of how text and composition come together to create meaning 
                        and interest. These type studies also establish an 
                        understanding of typographic experimentation, functionality,
                        and working within visual constraints/systems.

                        Raised in the Bay Area, something that 
                        Ava uses often for traveling back home is different

                        quiet days.The goal was to represent their sounds by 
                        layering each icon matching them with color schemes that 
                        not only create synergy but also capture their ethos.  
                        Sound is a huge part of San Franciscos' identity, working 
                        with opacities helps to visualize how sound lingers 
                        throughout the city.
