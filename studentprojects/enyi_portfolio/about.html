                    <p> My name is En-Yi Lin. I grew up in the Bay Area. I am currently a junior attending the University of San Francisco with a Design major and an Advertising minor. I plan to graduate in May 2024. As a person whose family enjoys traveling, I love capturing scenic views and moments in my life that I treasure. So far in my work, I have primarily focused on making designs with an aesthetic and minimalist look. I believe that some of the most simplest and unique designs could have an abundant meaning. Growing up, I have been going to Taiwan several times and observed a lot of small and adorable characters around the streets. From that, I drew inspiration to make my designs lovable, simple, and cute. My goals as a designer are to incorporate important matters such as bringing awareness to Asian cultures, bringing awareness to living a more sustainable lifestyle, and serving the communities. I believe that designers have the ability to inform people, with the hopes of changing peopleâ€™s perspectives. </p>
