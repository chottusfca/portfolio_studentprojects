                    <h2>Family Tattoo</h2>

                    <h2>Tattoo Design </h2>
                
                    <p>“Family Tattoo” is a tattoo design created to express my gratitude toward my family, specifically my parents and grandmother. Tattoos are outlets for people to express their uniqueness and individuality. After the sudden lost of my grandma our family was deeply saddened by her death. That same year, experiencing independence made me homesick, and appreciated my family even more. Taking into account my emotion, I wanted to create something that represented both my Chinese heritage and my family. The Chinese zodiac was the simplest way of representing them. My parent’s zodiac is a pig and my grandmother is a dog. The dog specifically is a dalmatian because growing up, Hundred and One Dalmatians was a classic favorite of mine. Putting the animals under an umbrella conveys the idea that no matter how far we are apart, we will always be together. Adding to the minimalist feel, Using thin strokes and simple shapes, help show the minimalist feel. Inspiration comes from the roots within you. You can find meaning in any little thing. It could be simple to the naked eye, but once you understand the deeper importance behind something it creates more value. </p>
