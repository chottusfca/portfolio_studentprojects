        Hello! This is Elise Emard, a current sophomore at the University of San Francisco, with plans to graduate in the Spring of 2025. She grew up in a small suburban city in Southern California, then moved to a bigger city in Northern California. 

        She is passionate about designing a world that everyone would want to live in. She gets most of her inspiration from past midcentury modern designers. Her goal is to take that and make it her own. Clean, colorful, abstract, and functional. She also takes pretty cool photos. Her photography is mostly of people and events current to her life. Sometimes she mixes the two of graphic design with her photography to make things frisky!
