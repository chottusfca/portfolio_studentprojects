                    <p>The PSA video project served as the final assigment for Design Fundamentals. Using video editing programs such as Photoshop Timelines or Premiere Pro, students created storyboards and then short films that would serve as public service announcements. 
                        My partner and I chose to make our movie about abstinence and its importance. As we educate ourselves further about safe sex and our reproductive rights and needs, we must also acknowledge the safest way to prevent any risks to oneâ€™s physical and mental health. 
                        This film was recorded with a video camera, imported into Adobe Premiere Pro, and edited within the program. Stock footage and grapics were used, as well as our own illustrations. We also made our own logo for the brand we created. </p></div>
