                    <p>The accordion book project was by far the most hands on assignment thus far. It focused on researching a designer and their life as well as their works. My partner and I chose Steven Holl, an architectural designer known for his minimalist yet unique look. We first picked out a color palette; to align with our sleek design, we chose more subtle hues that would let the buildings pop out on the page rather than compete with it for attention. We implemented some gradients throughout our book for some texture and even added a grainy overlay that is just visible enough to give more texture.  Our main design aspects were to highlight his style; he uses geometry, light, subtraction, and the site to design his buildings. We start with our cover, with just his name and an artistic render of one of his designs, the Markel Center. We chose to highlight this building because we believed it encompasses all of his design philosophies. With some linework over a low-opacity trace of the image, it stands out over the gradient of our color palette. </p>
