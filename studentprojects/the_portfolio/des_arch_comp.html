                <p>This project came with the goals of creating a square composition consisting of nine smaller squares; each of these squares began as a photograph of an architectural feature around campus and turned into an illustration through Illustrator.
                    The composition requires creativity and puzzle-solving abilities, as finding and making connections between different structures is not the simplest of tasks. Pictures with predominantly linear/ orthogonal features proved less difficult to blend, and gave the overall composition depth.
                    Using perspective photographs as well as creating a focal point with the library’s circular window added contrast. I chose somewhat bold colors for foreground forms while the background/ “sky” is a pastel tint; this helps the main shapes pop out.</p>
