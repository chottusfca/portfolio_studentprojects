                <p>The triptych project focused on connecting three different photographs, each at a different scale, through the features of each image. Using Photoshop, students blended and joined the three images into one final composition.For my Triptych assignment, I chose to focus on linearity in architecture around the city, whether that was verticality, horizons and landscapes, or even diagonals in building facades. I found these themes in three pictures. The picture on the left is the facade of Lo Schiavo on USFâ€™s campus. The middle picture is a perspective shot of a building in the Financial District near the Embarcadero. The last picture is a straight view of the Golden Gate Bridge. Each picture has elements of verticality and diagonals, and I connected the three through these aspects. The diagonals of the facade of Lo Schiavo cut into the diagonals of the middle building, while maintaining the them of a traditional structure/ building. The middle picture has the most lines stretching across every direction. I used the diagonal cable of the Bridge to reach down and overlap with a diagonal of the middle building, so it shows a seamless transition. With the connection of all three pictures, I experimented with some textures and saturations for some parts of the overall view. A triangle between the left and middle pictures gave opportunities for a different hue, as well as the openings in the bridge itself. I filled these spaces with a water texture and changed the hue and saturation so it is a bright orange. I also tinted the sky above the bridge to differentiate it with the blue within the bridge cables. </p></div>
