                    <p>Going into this project I saw a lot of ideas present themselves right away: homelessness, hate crimes, racism, the war in Ukraine. I wanted to follow all of these ideas and develop them further but I knew I did not have the time to do so. As a first-generation Asian immigrant living in California, I thought about the difficulties I have gone through and the current treatment of Asian Americans because of COVID-19. I landed on the idea of anti-Asian hate.I chose to show my piece in the form of newspaper clippings and headlines, along with pictures of the victims and survivors of hate crimes. Newspapers are becoming more and more obsolete as a medium for current events and other news, as social media and technology have taken over how we consume our information. Reverting back to a newspaper format implies the urgency of the content on the page, and the size of the “article” further emphasizes what is being displayed. It becomes exclusively a “read, not swipe” format in which the audience must pay attention in order to retain what they are consuming rather than simply glancing over some pictures and headlines.
                    This piece spoke to me in ways I didn’t expect, and I ended up connecting myself to it much more than I intended. Life isn’t just a civil right, but a human right. This seems to be illogical in the US, where race and ethnicity are politicized by those in power.</p>
