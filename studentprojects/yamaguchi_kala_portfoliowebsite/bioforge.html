                                BioForge is a startup company focused on re-engineering modern medicine by developing methods of reaction that aim to protect the healthy bacteria in our bodies commonly harmed by the standard antibiotic. Due to the company's early stages of development, my role was to create a brand that allowed for it to be easily understood by angel investors and venture capitalists.

                                Conceptually, the vision followed the literal definition of “forge”, where metal is heated up in a furnace and pounded with a hammer. The client wanted to convey a brand identity with similar thematic elements as it fit well with the “BioForge” name. 
                                
                                The designed logo hints at themes of fire while still using softer curves to keep the shape more organic. This was intentional due to the humane nature of the product. It lacks the intimidation that may come with a strong brand identity while still having the themes desired by the client.
