                                Big Brothers Big Sisters of Hawaii is an organization dedicated to helping Hawaii’s disadvantaged youth ignite their biggest possible futures through one-to-one mentorship programs. As a volunteer, I was given the task of designing a t-shirt for an up and coming event celebrating the 60th anniversary of the organization. 

                                As a tribute to the unique culture of Hawaii, the t-shirt design depicts a lei po’o (wreath of leaves meant to be worn around your head) sitting on the top of the “6” in the design.  The lei po’o in modern context is often given to someone to honor them during a time of celebration. It felt appropriate to connect this tradition with the “60” since that was the thing being celebrated. 
                                
                                The design follows much of the company's brand. It utilizes the three stripes that are similar to the “B” design  in the company's logo. But utilizes the circle shape to give it a fun and playful feel.
