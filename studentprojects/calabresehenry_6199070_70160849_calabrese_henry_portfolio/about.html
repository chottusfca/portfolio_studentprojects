            <p class="me_text"> Born in Los Angeles, I always gravitated towards the arts as a young child but it wasnâ€™t until a computer error on a 12th grade schedule that I was mistakenly put into an architecture class, and it was there that I discovered my love for architecture. The intersection of creativity and practicality is what makes this unique field so compelling to me, and I have developed a special interest in residential design. 
            Feeling a personal level of connection with architecture centered around housing, I have developed a passion for projects centered around affordable housing as well as the restructuring of urban morphology so as to better the lives of those in our communities.
            <br>
            <br> In the latter half of my college career I began exploring additional interests in graphic design. I enjoy searching for any opportunity to apply my design curriculum to my work in architecture, and it is through design that I have been able to expand and enhance my worldviews and architectural design process. <br><br>Currently finishing my final year at the University of San Francisco with a major in Architecture and minor in Design.</p>
