                        <h3>Description</h3>
                        <p>This poster, serving as a public service announcement, was made with the intention of bringing awareness to the striking amount of animal euthanizations in America. The first thing the viewer is meant to see is the "920,000," representing the number of animals euthanizaed annually. The empty cage is meant to be indicative of a recently euthanized dog, as the glowing paw prints strike similarities with the halos often depicted above angels' heads. At the bottom is a classic call to help, with a provided phone number for those who feel brought to action.</p>
