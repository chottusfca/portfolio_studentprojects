                        <h3>Description</h3>
                        <p>Above are featured elevation and section drawings pulled from an architecture project I completed in the Fall of 2021. In this project, I designed a museum with a focal piece being a large vortex made of glass, spanning over 30 feet in height. The vortex, observable in the above section view, captures rainwater and funnels it through to be dispersed into the ground of the museum, which is a series of pathways over a body of water. Although an architectural project, the drawings above were done primarily in Illustrator and are representative of my first attempt to combine my design curriculum with my work in architecture.</p>
